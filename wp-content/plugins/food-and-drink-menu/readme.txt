== Description ==

Easily create a stylish, responsive restaurant menu and add it to your site in minutes. With the easy-to-use menu builder, and the included layout and customization options, you'll have your menu set up in no time.

This plugin also lets you enable a food ordering system directly on your site from your menu page. This is available in the ultimate version, which you can read about in the **Food Ordering Straight from Your Menu** section below.

<strong>The plugin includes a Gutenberg restaurant menu block as well as a restaurant menu shortcode, so you can display your menu on any page, no matter which page editing system you are using. We also include several patterns, so you can integrate your menus directly into your block-based theme.</strong>

= Key Features =

* Unlimited restaurant menus and menu items.
* Responsive restaurant menu layout that looks great on mobile and all devices.
* Add your menu to any page via the included Gutenberg block or shortcode.
* Add unique photos and prices to each food or drink menu item .
* Optional sidebar to display your restaurant menu sections, for quick navigation.
* Full Menu schema structured data automatically integrated, so Google can correctly identify your page as a menu and use it accordingly in search results.
* Create a QR code that you can use in-restaurant to let your guests see your online menu.

<em>Five Star Restaurant Menu is very user friendly and comes with a walk-through that runs automatically when you activate the plugin and will help you create your menu items, add the menu to your site and set key options!</em>

= Restaurant Menu QR Code = 

This food menu plugin now comes with the ability for you to generate a QR code that leads directly to your online menu. You can place these, for example, at the tables in your restaurant, so guests can scan them and gain easy and quick access to the restaurant menu page on your website. 

There are several great benefits to utilizing your online menu in your restaurant, including:

* You can instantaneously make changes to your menu. No matter how small or big the change you need to make is, you won't need to reprint anything or explain it to every customer. 
* Save money and trees by avoiding the need to print your menus.
* Creates a more contactless experience, no longer having menus shared between all customers.

= Restaurant Menu Sections = 

The plugin comes with the ability to create separate restaurant menu sections. This allows you to divide a menu into multiple parts, making it more clear for your customers. You can even include a note for a section (e.g. "All items in this section come with salad or fries."). Some examples of menu sections you can create are:

* Appetizers
* Main Course
* Dessert Menu
* Kid's Menu
* Gluten Free Menu
* Weekly Specials

You can then add a sidebar to your menu page, which lists all your sections, so your guests can quickly find what they're looking for.

In addition to this, you can also create completely separate and customizable restaurant menus. This feature can be used for several different purposes including individual menus for different meals, but also separate menus for drinks or snacks. It even works great if your restaurant is split up into different areas (e.g. a dining hall, a cafe, a bistro, etc.). Some examples of individual restaurant menus you can create are:

* Breakfast Menu
* Brunch Menu
* Lunch Menu
* Dinner Menu
* Wine Menu
* Drink Menu
* Snack Menu
* Cafe Menu
* Specialty Menu
* The possibilities are endless!

= More Restaurant Menu Features = 

Our customizable restaurant menu and ordering plugin comes with several additional features that will help ensure you're able to set it up not only easily, but with all the options you need. It will also allow you to deliver the best and easiest drink and food menu experience for your visitors. These features include:

* Extra Gutenberg blocks to display individual restaurant menu sections or items on a page (instead of just a whole menu)
* Ability to add multiple prices for a single item
* Advanced restaurant menu template system for further layout customization
* Simple restaurant menu compatibility with WPML for multi-language sites
* Add a footer to each drink or food menu for legal disclaimers or other notes
* Display reviews for menu items (requires the premium version of the Five Star Restaurant Reviews plugin)
* Add a submit review form to menu items (requires the premium version of the Five Star Restaurant Reviews plugin)
* Widgets to display quick restaurant menu items in your sidebar or footer

= Premium Restaurant Menu =

With the premium version of our restaurant menu plugin, you can extend the functionality of your menu to offer your guests the best possible experience. This includes multiple layout options, the ability to add custom fields to your menu items, sorting and filtering options for your menu page, and much more.

Premium features include:

* Two new modern and responsive restaurant menu layouts.
* Custom menu fields to add any extra info you want to your restaurant menu items.
* Sorting, filtering and search options to let your customers find the exact meal or item they're looking for.
* Comprehensive icons to indicate dietary and ethical requirements, including organic, gluten-free, kosher, halal and many more.
* Badges for item features, specials and sales.
* Special/discount pricing.
* Google maps to show off local suppliers or ethical sourcing programs.
* Add a related items section to the single menu item page.
* Labelling options that let you change the wording for all the labels displayed on the front end of the plugin.
* Advanced styling options to change the fonts, colors, widths, borders, etc. of the different menu elements. 

By combining the sorting/filtering/search options with the badges, dietary icons and specials, you can be sure that your guests will be able to locate the best possible menu items for them in no time at all.

= Food Ordering Straight from Your Menu (Requires Ultimate Version) = 

The ultimate version of the Five Star Restaurant Menu plugin lets you add a complete food ordering system to your website. Stop paying commission to third-party services and start offering ordering directly on your site.

Key features of the food ordering platform include:

* Add-to-cart buttons for all menu items.
* Intuitive cart that fits into any theme and lets customers easily add items and check out. 
* Require payment immediately or give your customer the option to pay in store.
* Both Stripe and PayPal available as payment gateways.
* Email notifications both to you and your customers for new orders and order updates. 
* Easy-to-use admin interface lets you quickly manage orders.
* Syncs directly with the Five Star Restaurant Manager mobile app (iOS and Android), so you can manage the orders in the kitchen or on the go.

Setting it up couldn't be easier. When you enable the ordering feature, an "Add to Cart" button will appear on each menu item, which will let you add as many items as you want to the cart. There are also options to enable advanced ordering features, which let you have multiple prices per item as well as add-ons that guests can select when adding items to their cart.

From the cart, you can then increase and decrease the quanity, remove items and view any special requests or add-ons. Checkout is a breeze with the included options. You can set it so that customers are required to pay right away at checkout or give them the option to pay when they pick the food up. 

Combine this with the available custom fields feature, which lets you add new inputs to the order form, and you can set up the checkout process however you like. For example, you could have an option for delivery and then require immediated payment either via Stripe or PayPal.

Further customization features for the restaurant ordering system include:

* Add-ons for menu items, which can be selected when adding to cart (e.g. extra toppings).
* Restrict when ordering should be available by setting up a schedule. 
* Set a minimum order total (e.g. in dollars, euros, etc., depending on your chosen currency).
* Option to temporarily pause ordering (e.g. you are at capacity).
* Alternatively, set a maximum number of orders that you can take.
* Fields for the customer to leave notes for both individual items and the overall order.
* Add custom fields to the order form (e.g. if you require extra info from your customers, want to offer delivery, etc.).
* Styling and labelling options to further customize the order form to your site.

Once an order is placed, restaurant owners receive a customizable order notification that contains all of the order information by default. This is also created as an order in the plugin admin panel, where you can view all the details and change the status, which your customers can check right on your menu page via an intuitive order progress bar.

There are further options to customize the restaurant menu ordering experience by setting specific hours when the ordering should be available as well as advanced features that let you add customization options to each menu item (e.g. "Add bacon", "Upgrade to onion rings", etc.). There is also an array of styling options to modify the colors of the ordering elements, including the buttons, the cart and the progress bar.

= Five Star Restaurant Manager Mobile App = 

The ultimate version also syncs directly with our Five Star Restaurant Manager mobile app, for iOS and Android, which lets you manage your orders from your phone or tablet without needing to log in to your site/WordPress. With this, you can:

* View all new orders directly in the app.
* Change the status or individual orders (e.g. to preparing or ready).
* Access the customer's phone number or email address to quickly get in touch with them, if need be.

With these features, you can set the app up on a tablet in the kitchen, to prepare orders as they come in, or for you to manage them anywhere on the go!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I display my menu? =

You can either make use of the included 'Menu' Gutenberg block or the [fdm-menu id="1"] shortcode (just replace the id with the actual id of the menu you want to display).

= Can I add more than one price for a menu item (e.g. for variations)? =

You definitely can. Right underneath where you add the main price, you can click the 'Add Price' button and input the new price for your variation.

= How do I change the order of items on my menu? =

When editing a Menu Item, you’ll see a panel on the right-hand side which has an Order input field. Menu Items are listed in order of this value, from lowest to highest.

If you want one Menu Item to be listed after another, make sure it’s Order value is higher.

= How can I show that a collection of dishes come with a side? =

Each Menu Section can have a description. When available, it displays below the section title.

To add a description to a section, go to the Menu Items > Menu Sections page in your WordPress admin area. Click the Edit link below the section you’d like to change.

On the Edit screen, you’ll see an area to type in a description. This is a great place to put in details such as:

* All entrees come with a side salad or fries.
* Add cheese to any burger for $1. Add bacon for $2.
* Add fries and a coke to any order during lunchtime for just $10.

= Can I have different sections with the same name? =

Yes. It’s common for a restaurant to have two locations. Each location’s menu has a Starters section, but they might not have exactly the same Starters in each location. They need different sections with the same name.

You’ll soon learn that you can’t create two Menu Sections with the same name. To get around this, you’ll need to create your Menu Sections with unique names, like “Starters (Downtown)” and “Starters (Uptown)”.

You can then override these names when you adding the Menu Section to a Menu. To do this, click the Edit icon in the Menu Layout panel for the Menu Section.

You can then enter your preferred Menu Section name.

This name only applies to this Menu, so different Menus can each have sections with the same name.

= Can I customize the look and layout of my menu? =

The plugin comes with a base style, which inherits the look of your theme, as well as a classic style. There are also two extra premium styles available.

Since version 1.5 of this plugin, you can also make use of your theme’s [page templates](https://doc.fivestarplugins.com/plugins/food-and-drink-menu/user/advanced/page-templates).

If you want to make more bespoke customizations to the design and style of your menu, you may need to know CSS code and how to modify PHP templates. You can read some simple tutorials [here](https://doc.fivestarplugins.com/plugins/food-and-drink-menu/user/advanced/complex-layouts). 

= How can I indicate that we add a gratuity? =

Each Menu has an additional editor for the Menu Footer. You’ll see this when editing a menu.

The Menu Footer is a great place to add details such as:

* All parties of 6 or more will automatically be charged a gratuity of 10%.
* All dishes are cooked in a kitchen with nuts.
* All of our meat is free-range and sourced from local producers.

= I need to mark some dishes as vegetarian, spicy or similar? =

The premium version features a wide range of icons covering dietary needs, healthy choices and religious preferences.

= Is this compatible with WPML? =

This plugin includes a wpml-config.xml file which provides compatibility with the WPML multi-language plugin. Additionally, the plugin uses a custom post type. As such, if you enable our post type in the WPML settings, you’ll be able to create translations of your menu items. As well, all the strings/labels are localized in the code, so they will be picked up by WPML’s String Translation tool for easy direct translating.
